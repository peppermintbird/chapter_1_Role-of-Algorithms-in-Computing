### Transit Method and Transmission Spectroscopy

> **TRANSIT METHOD**

When an exoplanet passes in front of its host star (again, transits), it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a temporary decrease in brightness — similar to an eclypse. This dip in brightness is recorded as a characteristic pattern in the light curve.
